# weather condition detection project
industry name : earth
project title : weather condition detection

problem statement :To develop this application there was a need to get accurate weather reports for different locations of the earth all at a single place/hub
Project Description:- The WeatherHub application gives accurate information of weather i.e. temperature (in units such as Celsius, Kelvin and Fahrenheit) and Speed of wind (in units such as kph and mph). It is very important to check the weather report before take-off of any flight, launching of satellites and planning for new adventures etc. The WeatherHub consists of very cool features such as display information in different units and a very minimalistic design which is easy to use and understand. It is very convenient and reliable.

Project Details:- I created a React.js Template using Html, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap. Then created a form by which users can ask for accurate weather reports by entering the location and other different aspects as inputs then click on “Get Data” button. After that, API is called through Node.js and React technology and the weather report is displayed on user’s screen. I created a Microsoft student Azure account for deploying the project into the Azure. After creating Azure account, I used Static Web App Service of Azure services. I uploaded my project on in Azure
Primary Azure Technology:- Azure Static Web Apps, App Service, API Apps. Other Azure Technologies:- Visual Studio Code, Git.

Summary/Synopsis:- The WeatherHub application is able to provide accurate weather reports for different locations of the world all at a single place/hub. It supports different units of measurement of tempertaure(Celsius, Kelvin and Fahrenheit) and Speed of Wind(kph and mph). I used technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js and React to develop this application. The application is successfully deployed on Microsoft Azure using its Static Web Service and is ready to use by people. I hope it helps people to check weather reports of their destination all around the world. The Project GitHub repository and Demo URL are given below.
